# About
This website is statically coded which is not a good representation of how websites are built today, but it allows me to get a look under the hood of some of the features of React that I have been trying to understand. I used the acapella group Pentatonix as the subject, but the point of this site is to let me explore React and React Router and various event handlers (like the rainbow animation effect in the jumbotron).

The bulk of this website is an imitation of Pentatonix's official site (ptxofficial.com) as of Aug 2020, with mild variations where I felt the styles or function of the site could've been modified to make the site simpler. I also cut down on the number of images and videos due to how React loads them when they are statically typed versus pulled in via an API or database.

If you want to view this version of the site, which I recommend :), you may need to run an initial build with "npm run build" before being able to view it with "npm start" (which opens the site in Chrome and spins up a local dev server).
